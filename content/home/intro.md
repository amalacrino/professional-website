ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there! 
{style="font-size: 1.2rem; background: #FFB76B; background: linear-gradient(to right, #FFB76B 0%, #FFA73D 30%, #FF7C00 60%, #FF7F04 100%); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"}

Iâ€™m a **molecular ecologist** mainly interested in **plant microbiomes**. My research is a dynamic blend of theory drawn from evolutionary biology, community ecology, and multitrophic interactions, combined with cutting-edge tools in molecular biology, experimental evolution, high-throughput sequencing, and high-performance computing to delve deep into the mechanisms governing the interplay between plants and their microbiomes. My research focuses on answering important fundamental questions: how do microbiomes influence plant ecology and evolution? Which are the rules behind the assembly of plant microbial communities? Can we assemble/evolve microbiomes to drive changes in plant functional traits? How do microbiomes help invasive species to adapt to new environments? 

I'm an Assistant Professor of Plant Pathology at the University of Reggio Calabria (Italy). Our group is working on both fundamental and applied research on plant microbiomes, plant pathogens, and alternative strategies to protect our crops.
