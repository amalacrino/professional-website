After my PhD, I joined the [Friberg Lab](https://liu.se/en/research/friberg-lab) at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/) (Sweden) as a postdoc in evolutionary biology. Then, I moved to the [Bennett Lab](https://species-interactions.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://eeob.osu.edu/) (USA) as a postdoc, where my research focused on understanding the factors that drive microbiome assembly in plants. After, I joined the [Xu Lab](https://plant-x.uni-mainz.de/) at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Evolution/) (Germany) as a Junior Group Leader, where my work focused on understanding the influence of microbial communities in driving plant evolution. Staring fall 2022, I am back "home" to join my alma mater (University of Reggio Calabria, Italy) as Assistant Professor (RTDb for Italian folks) of Plant Pathology. I have raised >1 million EUR in research grants, served as external expert for grant reviewing panels, senior and associated editor for several journals, taught course internationally (Sweden, USA, Italy), and mentored >20 among PhD, MSc and BSc students.
