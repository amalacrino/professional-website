ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there! 
{style="font-size: 1.2rem; background: #FFB76B; background: linear-gradient(to right, #FFB76B 0%, #FFA73D 30%, #FF7C00 60%, #FF7F04 100%); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"}

Iâ€™m a **molecular ecologist** mainly interested in **plant microbiomes**. My research is a blend of theory drawn from evolutionary biology, community ecology, and multitrophic interactions, combined with cutting-edge tools in molecular biology, experimental evolution, high-throughput sequencing, and high-performance computing to delve deep into the mechanisms governing the interplay between plants and their microbiomes. My research focuses on answering important fundamental questions: how do microbiomes influence plant ecology and evolution? Which are the rules behind the assembly of plant microbial communities? Can we assemble/evolve microbiomes to drive changes in plant functional traits? How do microbiomes help invasive species to adapt to new environments?

The [**Malacrino Lab**](https://malacrinolab.netlify.app/) at Clemson University will open its doors in January 2025 as part of the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/biosci/index.html). The lab will focus on fundamental and applied research on microbiomes.

Visit our new website to learn about our research and opportunities to join us!
