abstract: Consecutive monoculture regimes lead to the emergence of soil-borne diseases, which in turn impair plant growth and soil health, and restrict sustainable agricultural production. Biochar and plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPBs) amendment in soil is considered a potential strategy for reducing soil-borne diseases. However, the combined effects of biochar and PGPBs on plant microbiomes and the subsequent consequences on plant performance remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the mechanisms on how biochar and biochar combined with a Bacillus synthetic community (SynCom) alleviated replant disease in Radix pseudostellariae by modulating rhizosphere soil protistan and plant microbial communities based on lab and field experiment. First, we found that biochar with Bacillus SynCom treatment increased the abundance of beneficial Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. after exposure to Fusarium oxysporum. Field experiments showed that biochar alone and combined with Bacillus SynCom improved the physiological traits and main components of Radix pseudostellariae. Besides, we found both two treatments increased Bacillus abundances in the root and soil, and significantly decreased Fusarium oxysporum density in the three compartments. Last, we validated that the combined treatment significantly decreased the relative abundance of pathogenic Ralstonia, promoted the abundance of Bacillus in the root and Paenibacillus in the leaf, and increased the abundance of the predatory protists Cercomonas and Paracercomonas in the soil. In addition, the combined amendment significantly increased the relative abundance of parasitic protists and decreased the plant pathogens. Meanwhile, the abundance of soil parasitic protists exhibited a significantly negative relationship with F. oxysporum density, and positive relationship with Bacillus density. Especially, soil pH and NO3âˆ’-N had a significantly indirect and positive effect on the parasitic protists and biomass by influencing bacterial richness of R. pseudostellariae leaf and root. Overall, our results revealed that amendment with combined biochar and Bacillus SynCom efficiently improved soil-borne disease suppression and plant physiological parameters by remodeling the plant and rhizosphere microbiome. This study provides a practical basis for more sustainable agriculture by promoting plant health through the modulation of plant and soil microbiomes.
