After my PhD, I joined the [Friberg Lab](https://liu.se/en/research/friberg-lab) at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/) (Sweden) as a postdoc in evolutionary biology. Then, I moved to the [Bennett Lab](https://species-interactions.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://eeob.osu.edu/) as a postdoc, where my research focused on understanding the factors that drive microbiome assembly in plants. After, I joined the [Xu Lab](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Evolution/plantadapt/groupmain.shtml) at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Evolution/) as a Junior Group Leader, where my work focused on understanding the influence of microbial communities in driving plant evolution. Staring fall 2022, I am back "home" to join my alma mater (University of Reggio Calabria, Italy) as Assistant Professor of Plant Pathology.

I am currently Senior Editor for [Annals of Applied Biology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17447348) and Associate Editor for [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210X). I have raised >300k EUR in research grants, served as external expert for grant reviewing panels, taught course in Sweden and USA, and mentored >15 among PhD, MSc and BSc students.
