**I’m a molecular ecologist interested in plant-microorganism interaction**. I mix theory from community ecology, experimental evolution, and multitrophic interactions with tools such as molecular biology, high-throughput sequencing, and high-performance computing to investigate the mechanisms behind the interactions between plants and their microbiome. My research focuses on answering important fundamental questions: how do microbiomes influence plant ecology and evolution? What are the drivers of microbial community assembly in plants? How do microbiomes help invasive species to adapt to new environments? 

After my PhD, I joined the [Friberg Lab](https://liu.se/en/research/friberg-lab) at [Linköping University](https://liu.se/) (Sweden) as a postdoc in evolutionary biology. Then, I moved to the [Bennett Lab](https://species-interactions.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://eeob.osu.edu/) as a postdoc, where my research focused on understanding the factors that drive microbiome assembly in plants. After, I joined the [Xu Lab](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Evolution/plantadapt/groupmain.shtml) at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Evolution/) as a Junior Group Leader, where my work focused on understanding the influence of microbial communities in driving plant evolution. Now, I am back "home" to join my alma mater (University of Reggio Calabria, Italy) in fall 2022 as Assistant Professor of Plant Pathology.

I am currently Senior Editor for [Annals of Applied Biology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17447348) and Associate Editor for [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210X). I have raised >300k EUR in research grants, served as external expert for grant reviewing panels, taught course in Sweden and USA, and mentored >15 among PhD, MSc and BSc students.
